# Get Started

Here‚Äôs a quick rundown to start using the app:

- **Wallet**: You need a wallet to store funds and pay for uploads.
  - First time? The app will guide you to create or import a wallet.
- **Funds**: Add a tiny amount of ETH and ANT tokens to your wallet:
  - Get them from a crypto exchange, community faucet, or community member.
  - Send them to the wallet address shown in the "Wallet" tab.
- **Tabs**:
  - **Wallet**: Manage your funds and wallet settings.
  - **Upload**: Send files to the blockchain (Public = anyone can see; Private = encrypted).
  - **Download**: Retrieve files using an address.
  - **Manage Files**: Organize or remove your uploads.

### Quick Start Example
1. Go to the "Wallet" tab, click "Create a New Wallet," and set a password.
2. Send a small amount of ETH and ANT to your wallet address.
3. Go to "Upload," check "Public," and upload a photo.
4. Copy the address shown, then use it in "Download" to get your photo back!

# Troubleshooting

- **‚Äúpython: command not found‚Äù**: Python isn‚Äôt installed or added to PATH. Recheck Step 1.
- **App doesn‚Äôt start**: Ensure you‚Äôre in the right folder and typed `python ctrl.py` correctly.
- **Wallet issues**: Save your private key securely‚Äîit‚Äôs your backup!

# Important Notes

- **Funds Safety**: Only send small amounts of ETH and ANT. The app developer isn‚Äôt responsible for lost funds.
- **Private Key**: When creating a wallet, save your private key somewhere safe. You‚Äôll lose access to your funds without it.

Enjoy trying **Mission Ctrl**! üöÄ
